# Roadmap: Immediate Next Steps (Phase 0)

## Objective
To validate the core concepts and establish the foundational community and tools for the project.

## Q4 2025 - Q2 2026
1.  **Project Launch & Onboarding:**
    *   [ ] **Finalize and publicly publish** the GitHub repository with the complete `/0-META` to `/4-STRESS_TESTS` structure.
    *   [ ] **Draft a Contributor's Guide** outlining how engineers, ethicists, and researchers can contribute.
    *   [ ] **Identify and recruit** key contributors from AI ethics, distributed systems, and cryptography.

2.  **Specification Refinement:**
    *   [ ] **Solicit community feedback** on the Core Principles and Meta-Principles. Initiate a Request for Comments (RFC) period.
    *   [ ] **Formalize the JSON Schemas** into a machine-readable standard and publish them as a versioned package.

3.  **Prototype Development (The "Minimum Viable Council"):**
    *   [ ] **Develop a prototype Ledger Node** implementing the basic Ledger Protocol (hashing, chaining, API).
    *   [ ] **Develop a simple CLI tool** to submit an `EthicalQueryEntry` to the prototype ledger.
    *   [ ] **Simulate the first stress test** manually by having humans role-play as the AI Specialist Modules and Adjudicator, using the prototype ledger to record the "debate" and "ruling".
