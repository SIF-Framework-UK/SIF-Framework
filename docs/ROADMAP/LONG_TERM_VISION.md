# Roadmap: Long-Term Vision & Future Phases

## Phase 3: Maturation & Audit (2028)
*   **Formal Verification:** Begin the process of formally verifying critical components of the codebase against the constitutional principles.
*   **Governance Handover:** Transition control of the project's development roadmap to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) comprised of Human Jurists and long-term contributors.
*   **Third-Party Audits:** Commission full security and ethical audits from leading external firms.

## Phase 4: Mainnet Launch & Initial Integration (2029+)
*   **Mainnet Launch:** Launch the production version of the SIF network. This is a quiet, significant event, not a public product launch.
*   **Initial Use Cases:** Begin with low-risk, high-value integrations:
    *   **Scientific Research:** Providing ethical oversight for complex AI-driven research proposals.
    *   **Open-Source AI Projects:** Allowing leading open-source AI projects to voluntarily submit their own actions for review.
*   **Continuous Evolution:** The system continues to learn and refine its precedent library, guided by its Human Jurists and its own principles.
