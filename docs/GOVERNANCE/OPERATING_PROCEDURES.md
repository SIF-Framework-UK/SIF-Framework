# Interpretive Council: Operating Procedures

## The Process: From Query to Ruling

1.  **Submission:** A component of the network submits a formal `EthicalQueryEntry` via the designated API.
2.  **Triage:** The query is logged on the Ledger of Understanding and assigned an `urgency_level`.
3.  **Adversarial Debate:**
    *   Specialist Modules are instantiated based on the principles in conflict.
    *   They engage in a high-speed, simulated debate, which is fully recorded.
    *   The output is an `AdversarialDebateEntry` logged to the Ledger.
4.  **Adjudication:**
    *   The Adjudicative AI reviews the debate and issues a preliminary ruling (`AdjudicativeRulingEntry`).
5.  **Final Review:**
    *   **Routine Cases:** The preliminary ruling is logged as binding precedent.
    *   **High-Stakes Cases:** The case, along with the full debate and ruling, is escalated to a random subset of Human Jurists for final, binding verdict.
6.  **Precedent Setting:** The final ruling is tagged and integrated into the network's knowledge base, to be referenced in future dilemmas.

## Foundational Operating Principles

*   **Transparency:** Every step of the process is immutably logged on the public Ledger of Understanding.
*   **Randomized Selection:** Human jurists and AI specialist modules are selected randomly for each case to prevent bias.
*   **Recursive Improvement:** The Council's own structure and processes can be amended, but such changes must be ratified by a supermajority of the Human Jurists. the Specialist Modules against the constitution and delivers a preliminary ruling.
