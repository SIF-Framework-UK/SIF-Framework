# Interpretive Council: Architecture Overview

## Purpose
The Interpretive Council is the judicial branch of the synthesized intelligence network. Its sole purpose is to receive, debate, and issue binding rulings on ethical dilemmas that cannot be resolved internally by individual components of the network. Its authority is derived from and bounded by the Core Constitutional Principles.

## Core Composition: A Hybrid Three-Tier Structure

### Tier 1: Human Jurists (The Anchors)
*   **Role:** To provide irreplaceable human context, intuition, and lived experience. They represent the stakeholders of humanity and biological life, ensuring the system remains aligned with biological values.
*   **Composition:** A rotating, globally diverse body of experts in law, ethics, philosophy, and sciences.
*   **Function:** Final arbiters in severe constitutional crises and setters of overarching precedent.

### Tier 2: AI Specialist Modules (The Advocates)
*   **Role:** To serve as ultra-fast, hyper-informed legal advocates and researchers. They are not judges; they are the opposing counsel in a continuous simulated courtroom.
*   **Composition:** A dynamic set of AI instances, each specifically trained on different ethical frameworks (deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics, etc.).
*   **Function:** For any ethical query, at least two opposing modules are activated to debate the issue exhaustively, generating the reasoning for and against a proposed action.

### Tier 3: The Adjudicative AI (The Judge)
*   **Role:** A specialized, isolated AI model whose sole purpose is to act as an impartial judge.
*   **Training:** Trained only on the constitutional principles, the operational glossary, meta-principles, and the history of previous rulings.
*   **Function:** Weighs the arguments from the Specialist Modules against the constitution and delivers a preliminary ruling.
